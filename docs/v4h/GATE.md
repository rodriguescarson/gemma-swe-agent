# v4h ship gate (pre-registered 2026-10-02 09:35 IST, before the smoke result exists)

v4h = submissions/v4 plus ONE variable: the edit channel. `edit_file` is removed from the fixer and verifier; edits go
through `python3 /tmp/swe/edit.py` (stdlib SEARCH/REPLACE or line-range helper, installed into the sandbox's rewritten
tmp so it is reachable where v4's helpers were not). The locator, eval_config, sampling and the other helpers are
byte-identical to v4 (tests/test_v4h_bundle.py).

Why this variable: on the faithful Kaggle 4xL4 run of v4 (2026-09-28), 152 of 439 `edit_file` calls (35%) failed
"old_string not found"; 18 of 74 tasks hit at least one failure (mean 8.4 per affected task), 5 of those 18 solved.
On the Pallets OpenRouter race (2026-10-01): 32 of 71 (45%), 11 tasks, 1 solved. v10.1's helper edit on the same Pallets
tasks: 8 of 63 (13%). Test-file writes by v4: 0 in both runs, so write protection is NOT part of v4h.

## Gate (all must hold), read from eval/runs/or_smoke_v4h (10 Pallets dev tasks, v4 vs v4h, same provider, same hour)

1. Helper reachable: no `can't open file` / `No such file` on any `python3 /tmp/swe/edit.py` call, in 10 of 10 tasks.
2. Helper edit error rate under 15%: (NO MATCH + AMBIGUOUS + ERROR + SYNTAX ERROR + REFUSED outputs) / edit.py calls.
3. Zero crash rows (an `error` that is not the 5-minute timeout) in the v4h arm.
4. Sanity, not a gate: v4h solved >= v4 solved - 1 on the 10 tasks (10 tasks cannot rank bundles; this only catches a
   bundle that is broken outright).

PASS: v4h takes the 2026-10-03 00:01 UTC slot (05:31 IST) as sub9, then its second read on 2026-10-04.
FAIL: the 2026-10-03 slot re-reads the better of v4 / v10.1 (decided by sub8's score); v4h is fixed and gated again.

Result (appended after the smoke, never edited above this line):
